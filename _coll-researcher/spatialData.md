## Raster Data

Geospatial data best represented in raster format generally has values at 
every point.  The area to be represented is split up into a grid, with each 
grid cell containing a value. Elevation, temperature, precipitation are 
examples of data generally represented as raster.

## Vector Data

Geospatial data best represented in vector format can be represented as points, 
lines, or polygons.  

**Point**: Points represent a single location on a 2 dimensional surface.  
Depending on the scale, different types of data are appropriate to be 
represented as points. At a very small scale (think of from a very great 
distance), a city might be represented as a single point.  Species occurrences 
are usually represented as points.

**Line**: Lines are made up of multiple points, joined.  Roads and rivers are 
usually represented as rivers.  

**Polygon**: Polygons are made up of multiple points or lines, joined to define 
a discrete area.  At a larger scale (zoomed in), a city, river, or street might 
be represented as a polygon. Administrative boundaries, like country, state, or 
other geo-political units are examples of polygon data.

## Scale

Large scale maps generally refer to maps of a small area with a lot of detail.  
It is called large because where the ratio between distance on the map to 
distance on the ground is very large.  For example 1:5000 means that 1 unit on 
the map (i.e. centimeter) equals 5000 units on the ground (5000 centimeters).  
This type of map might be used for a detailed map of a city.  

Small scale maps are generally used for mapping large areas.  The ratio of the 
distance on the map to the distance on the ground is much smaller.  For example, 
a map of the country of Indonesia might be at the ratio of 1:2,000,000.
