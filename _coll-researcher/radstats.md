## Lifemapper Multi-Species Range and Diveristy (RAD) Statistics


### Site-based statistics (for species)
* Alpha (species richness)
* Alpha Prop (proportional species richness)
* Phi (total range size)
* Phi Prop (proportional species range size)

### Site-based statistics (for tree)
* Mean Nearest Taxon Distance (for each species in this site, how taxonomically 
  close is its closest relative in this site)
* Mean Pairwise Distance (for each species in this site, how taxonomically 
  close are all other species in this site)
* Pearson’s correlation coefficient

### Species statistics
* Omega (range size)
* Omega Prop (range size in proportion to the total of all range sizes)
* PSI (the richness of a species’ range)
* PSI Prop (species range richness in proportion to richness all species ranges)

### Beta diversity statistics
* Whittakers Beta
* Landes Additive Beta
* Legendres Beta

### Covariance Matrices
* Sites composition
* Species ranges

### Schluter’s statistics
* Species variance ratio
* Sites variance ratio
