## Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) 
SDM is also known by several other names, 
including environmental niche modeling, ecological niche modeling, and habitat 
modeling.  SDM refers to the process of creating mathematical formulas (models) 
to predict the geographic distribution of species based on where they have been 
found and the environmental conditions in those locations. The environmental 
conditions climate, elevation, soil type, land use or land cover, and other 
variables.  These models can be applied to the same environmental conditions 
for other locations or other time periods (predicted past or future), creating 
maps showing other areas with similar conditions. This technique is used in 
conservation, ecology and evolutionary biology.

### Case Study
A recent study by Jorge Soberón, research scientist at the KU Biodiversity 
Institute, illustrates the power of Species Distribution Modeling.

The problem begins in the 1920s, when prickly pear cacti were an invasive 
species in Australia and huge fields of the plant took over the native 
landscape. To combat the cacti, the Australian government shipped in cactus 
moths.  The cactus moth, Cactoblastis cactorum, native to Argentina, had a taste 
for prickly pear and helped control the problem for many years. However, by 
1989, the cactus moth had island-hopped its way from Australia to Florida, where 
hundreds of species of endangered cacti live. Scientists worried that the moth 
would destroy cacti populations in Florida and then move on to Mexico, where 
cacti are an important part of the agricultural economy and an essential food 
source for cattle and people.

Scientists from various fields of study needed to know, ‘Where is it going to 
attack?’ According to Soberon, “We had to predict the distribution of this 
little moth ahead of time.” The cacti of concern were spread throughout so many 
countries that scientists needed to know where to focus their efforts to protect 
them.

Cactus in the most vulnerable areas are being protected thanks to Soberón's 
modeling research.
