## Goal
The goal is to create a nice, dynamically updated webpage with visualizations 
of the Lifemapper Catalog contents, status, and speed of computation.  The 
visualization need not be published on a live site, but should query the live
KU Lifemapper services.

## Background
To get an overall understanding of the Lifemapper Software and the contents of 
the Catalog, read the [Overview](/overview.html) page.

## Documentation
The [Python client library] (/lmclient/index) is not currently up to date.  
[REST API](api.html) documentation allows you to construct and 
test raw URL queries, which can then be constructed and called in any 
programming language.
