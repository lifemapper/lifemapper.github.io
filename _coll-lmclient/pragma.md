## Goal
The goal is to create a nice, dynamically updated webpage with visualizations 
of the Lifemapper Catalog contents, status, and speed of computation.  The 
visualization need not be published on a live site, but should query the live
KU Lifemapper services.

## Background
To get an overall understanding of the Lifemapper Software and the contents of 
the Catalog, read the [Overview](/overview.html) page.

## Documentation
The [Python client library] (/lmclient/index) is an easy way to access 
Lifemapper services.  Example code is linked off this page.  If you prefer
to call the web services from another language, check out the 
[REST API](api.html) documentation.  These pages allow you to construct and 
test raw URL queries.
