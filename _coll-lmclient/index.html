      <p>
         The Lifemapper Client Library is a Python package that allows you to
         interact with the Lifemapper web services.  It abstracts away the 
         details of the requests and responses and allows you to treat them
         as Python functions.
         <br /><br />
         For installation and configuration of the Lifemapper Client Library,
         read <a href="/lmclient/configure.html">the configuration documentation</a>.
