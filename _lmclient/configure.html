      <h1>Configuring the Lifemapper Client Library</h1>
      <p>
         Version 3.3.4 of the Lifemapper client library includes configuration 
         options.  These options are not applicable for most users but they are 
         useful for those users that have their own Lifemapper server 
         installation or wish to use an installation other than the main 
         Lifemapper web services. 
      </p>
      <hr />
      <!-- ............................................................... -->
      <h2><a id="simple">Simple Configuration</a></h2>
      
      <p>
         For most installations, the default options are fine.  To configure 
         the Lifemapper Client Library, you will only need to copy the example
         configuration file and set an environment variable to point at it. 
         The exact procedure is depends on your platform but it has two steps:
         <ol>
            <li>Copy example-config.ini into a path you can access</li>
            <li>
               Set the environment variable "LIFEMAPPER_CONFIG_FILE" and have
               it point at the location of this file.
            </li>
         </ol>
         Note, this variable will need to be set whenever you wish to use the 
         client library so it would be useful to include it in your user 
         initialization (such as .bash_rc for Linux).
      </p>
      
      <hr />
      <!-- ............................................................... -->
      <h2><a id="advanced">Advanced Configuration</a></h2>
      
      <p>
         If you need to modify the configuration file to point at a different 
         installation of the Lifemapper web services, you will start by 
         following the steps of the <a href="#simple">simple configuration</a>.
         Then, open the file and edit the values as necessary, the 
         configuration options and their descriptions are listed below.
      </p>

      <h3>[LmCommon - common] section</h3>
      <p>
         <b>ARCHIVE_USER</b> - This is the default user for the Lifemapper web
         services.  You should only change this if you have your own Lifemapper
         Server installation that has a different default user.
      </p>

      <p>
         <b>CONCURRENT_PROCESSES</b> - This parameter is not used with version
         3.3.0 of the client library, but if you choose to take advantage of 
         the SubprocessManager class in LmCommon, you may find it useful.  This
         parameter controls how many concurrent processes Lifemapper will use
         when using subprocesses.
      </p>

      <p>
         <b>ENCODING</b> - This is the default encoding to use when working 
         with the Lifemapper Client Library.  The default is UTF-8 and that is
         probably fine for most users.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <b>OGC_SERVICE_URL</b> - This is the base URL for Lifemapper OGC map
         outputs.  This should only be changed if you are using a different 
         Lifemapper Server installation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <b>WEBSERVICES_ROOT</b> - This is the base URL for Lifemappwer web 
         services.  This should only be changed if you are using a different 
         Lifemapper Server installation.
      </p>

      <h3>[LmClient - Open Tree of Life] section</h3>
      
      <p>
         <b>OTL_HINT_URL</b> - This parameter sets the base URL for the Open
         Tree of Life hint service.  This parameter should only be changed if 
         the OTL project changes the URL for this service.
      </p>

      <p>
         <b>OTL_TREE_WEB_URL</b> - This parameter sets the base URL for the 
         Open Tree of Life tree retrieval service.  This parameter should only
         be changed if the OTL project changes the URL for this service.
