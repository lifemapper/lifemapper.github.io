## Overview

The Lifemapper software is described in [Overview](overview.html).  Lifemapper
enables Species Distribution Modeling ([SDM](sdm.html)) for one or more species,

at landscape levels over multiple dimensions, including time, geography, and 
evolution.

To understand how to use the service types and workflows below, start with
