<p>
Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) is also known by several other names, 
including ecological-niche modeling, and habitat modeling.  The purpose is 
to correlate environmental values, for example climate, elevation, soils, and other 
variables, with geographic locations where a species has been found.  This 
correlation is computed with an "algorithm", to create a model that
defines the relationship of the environmental variables to known locations of 
the species. 

The model may then be applied to the same types of environmental, possibly
for other regions or for predicted past or future climates, to predict whether 
the species may live in those locations, or under those past or future 
conditions.
