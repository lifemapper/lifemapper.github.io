The Lifemapper software can be logically thought of as having two primary 
components: geospatial data and analysis tools. 

The first, geospatial data, consists of a library of species and environmental 
data, including climate data (elevation, and observed climate, and predicted 
past, future climate), specimen occurrences (known locations where an organism 
has been collected), and computed maps of geographic locations with similar 
climate and elevation where the species could thrive. All of these data may be
browsed, queried, and downloaded using the Lifemapper web services.

The second, is a suite of tools for analysis of both single-, and multi-species 
datasets.  Single-species analyses are at the heart of the data library
described above, and are encompassed in a module named Lifemapper Species
Distribution Modeling, or LmSDM. Multi-species analyses are contained by the 
module named Lifemapper Range and Diversity, or LmRAD.
