<h2>Single-species Analysis</h2>

<p>
A typical Lifemapper workflow to analyze data for single species consists of 
computing a Species Distribution Model (SDM), and producing maps of potential
habitat from these models.  Inputs include:
<ul>
   <li> <a href="https://github.com/lifemapper/lifemapper.github.io/blob/master/docs/api/occurrences.rst">
         Occurrence Data</a>
        for a single species or taxa.  Species data may be from the Lifemapper
        data library (usually a data aggregator, such as the Global Biodiversity
        Information Facility (GBIF, <a href="www.gbif.org/>) </li>
   <li> A 
        <a href="https://github.com/lifemapper/lifemapper.github.io/blob/master/docs/api/scenario.rst">
        Scenario</a>
        (set) of 
        <a href="https://github.com/lifemapper/lifemapper.github.io/blob/master/docs/api/layers.rst">
        Environmental Layers</a> 
        corresponding to the approximate time period of the species data 
        (distant past, or current day). Lifemapper makes available Global Climate 
        data for past, current, and future time periods from Worldclim
        (<a href="http://worldclim.org>) </li>
   <li> An 
        <a href="https://github.com/lifemapper/lifemapper.github.io/blob/master/docs/api/algorithm.rst">
        Algorithm</a> for computing the relationship between species occurrences
        and environmental values.
</p>

<p>
Each individual Environmental Layer must have a 
<a href="https://github.com/lifemapper/lifemapper.github.io/blob/master/docs/api/typecodes.rst">
Type Code</a>
which allows the software to identify the type of layer when <i>projecting</i> 
the model back onto the same or matching scenario. Scenarios <i>match</i> if 
they contain layers with the same type codes. Layers sharing type codes must 
represent the same type of environmental data, with the same units of 
measurement.
<p>

<h2>Multi-species Analyses</h2>
<p>
A typical Lifemapper workflow to analyze multi-species data is more
complex and flexible. Some or all analysis steps can be executed,   
Inputs generally start with:
<ul>
   <li>Species layers.  These layers can be raster or vector format, and can 
       be predicted (i.e. SDM output projections) or other types of distribution 
       maps.  </li>
   <li>
