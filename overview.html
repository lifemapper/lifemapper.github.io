<p>
Lifemapper (Lm) is a high-throughput species distribution modeling system and 
set of multi-species analysis tools.  Started in 1999, Lifemapper was created to 
compute, archive and web publish, species distribution models (“SDMs”, also 
known as species niche models and predicted habitat models) using all available 
online species occurrence data. Using the Lifemapper platform, known species 
localities georeferenced from museum specimens are combined with climate models 
to predict a species’ “niche” or potential habitat availability, under current 
day and future climate change scenarios.  The SDM components compute these 
single-species predictions.  
</p>

<p>
The original Lifemapper *Catalog* at the University of Kansas, U.S.A.,
contains occurrence data, provided by the Global Biodiversity Information 
Facility (GBIF, http://gbif.org), and predicted suitable habitat for species
contained within.  The data are organized by *accepted* species name, as 
defined by the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy.  
</p>


<p>
Lifemapper Range and Diversity, “RAD", extends Lifemapper from creating 
single-species predictions to large-scale multi-species, landscape-level 
analyses.  The RAD components calculate multi-species biodiversity analyses 
by creating a binary presence-absence matrix (PAM) for a large number of species 
from SDM outputs or other species range maps, then computing a number of 
biodiversity measures from it. 
</p>

<p>
Lifemapper Meta-Community Phylogenetic Analyses, “MCPA", extends Lifemapper  
computations on a multi-species PAM created by the Lifemapper RAD components
by connecting a phylogenetic tree for species in the PAM and computing 
correlations between geographic elements (biogeographic hypotheses) and the
distribution and evolution of species.  Outputs are returned in a package 
allowing users to dynamically query linked data visualizations: maps, trees, 
and scatterplots.
</p>

<p>
The Lifemapper platform is a large but modular web services-based system of 
three core software components: 
<ol>
   <li>  LmServer for data management and communications; </li>
   <li>  LmCompute for calculations; and </li>
   <li>  and an API and website for browsing the public archive and requesting
         analyses. </li>
</ol>
The LmCompute and LmServer modules are both involved in 
modeling operations. LmCompute instances request jobs from LmServer, execute 
them, then post the model results back to LmServer where data are written to 
storage and metadata to the PostgreSQL database. Two applications on LmCompute 
underlie SDM calculations: openModeller and MaxEnt, while all RAD and MCPA 
calculations are performed by Lifemapper code. From LmServer APIs and the 
website, a user can request public input and computed data.
