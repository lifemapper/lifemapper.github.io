Lifemapper (Lm) is a high-throughput species distribution modeling system and 
set of multi-species analysis tools.  Started in 1999, Lifemapper was created to 
compute, archive and web publish, species distribution models (“SDMs”, also 
known as species niche models and predicted habitat models) using all available 
online species occurrence data. Using the Lifemapper platform, known species 
localities georeferenced from museum specimens are combined with climate models 
to predict a species’ “niche” or potential habitat availability, under current 
day and future climate change scenarios.  The SDM components compute these 
single-species predictions.  The MaxEnt application drives all SDM calculations.

The original Lifemapper *Catalog* at the University of Kansas, U.S.A.,
contains occurrence data, provided by the Global Biodiversity Information 
Facility (GBIF, http://gbif.org), and predicted suitable habitat for species
contained within.  The data are organized by *accepted* species name, as 
defined by the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy.

Lifemapper Range and Diversity, “RAD", extends Lifemapper from creating 
single-species predictions to large-scale multi-species, landscape-level 
analyses.  The RAD components calculate multi-species biodiversity analyses 
by creating a binary presence-absence matrix (PAM) for a large number of species 
from SDM outputs or other species range maps, then computing a number of 
biodiversity measures from it.

Lifemapper Meta-Community Phylogenetic Analyses, “MCPA", extends Lifemapper  
computations on a multi-species PAM created by the Lifemapper RAD components
by connecting a phylogenetic tree for species in the PAM and computing 
correlations between geographic elements (biogeographic hypotheses) and the
distribution and evolution of species.  Outputs are returned in a package 
allowing users to dynamically query linked data visualizations: maps, trees, 
and scatterplots.
