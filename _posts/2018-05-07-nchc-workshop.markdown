Terminology used in Lifemapper and these documents are summarized in 
[Terminology](/terms).

## Background
To get an overall understanding of Lifemapper and geospatial data, read:
  * Types of spatial data in the context of Lifemapper are summarized 
    [spatial data](/researcher/spatialData)
  * [Meta-Community Phylogenetic Analyses](/researcher/mcpa)
  
## Species Distribution Modeling (SDM)
The potential distribution of individual species may be predicted using SDM tools:
  * Overview of [Species Distribution Modeling (SDM)](/researcher/sdm)
  * [Explore](/training/exploreData) SDM data from the LM Library
  * Request species [SDMs](/training/sdmTraining) through the website

## Multi-species analyses
Distributions of many species may be combined to look at biodiversity at 
landscape levels: 
  * Overview of [Multi-species Analyses](/researcher/rad)
  * Request [Multi-species Analyses](/training/boomTraining) using 
    researcher-provided data.
  * Data for multi-species exercises is available on the USB stick or from
    [here](http://yeti.lifemapper.org/dl/taiwan_boom_data.tar.gz).

## Meta-Community Phylogenetic Analyses (MCPA)
Additional phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses can be performed with 
a phylogenetic (evolutionary) tree containing the same species and 
bio-geographic maps of regions for which to compare species communities:
  * Overview of [MCPA](/researcher/mcpa)
  * [Visualize and Explore](/training/mcpaVizTraining) Meta-Community 
    Phylogenetic Analyses.  Two subsets are available from the USB drive
    or for download:
    * [Rubiaceae](http://yeti.lifemapper.org/dl/Rubiaceae.zip) 
    * [Geometridae](http://yeti.lifemapper.org/dl/Geometridae.zip) 
  * [Subset](/training/subsetTraining) SDM for species
