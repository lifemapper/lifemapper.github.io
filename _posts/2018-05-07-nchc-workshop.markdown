Terminology used in Lifemapper and these documents are summarized in 
[Terminology](/terms)

## Background
To get an overall understanding of the single- and multi-species analyses 
available through the Lifemapper software, read:
  * [Spatial Data](/researcher/spatialData)
  * [Species Distribution Modeling (SDM)](/researcher/sdm)
  * [Multi-species Analyses](/researcher/rad)
  * [Meta-Community Phylogenetic Analyses](/researcher/mcpa)
  
## Hands-On with LM Library data
Step by step instructions for using the web client to explore, analyze, and 
visualize existing Lifemapper SDM data (the LM Library).
  * [Explore](/training/exploreData) SDM data from the LM Library
  * Request species [SDMs](/training/sdmTraining) through the website
  * [Subset](/training/subsetTraining) SDM for species
  * [Visualize and Explore](/training/mcpaVizTraining) Meta-Community 
    Phylogenetic Analyses

## Hands-On with researcher data
Data for these exercises is available for [download]() or from the provided
USB drive.
  * Request [Multi-species Analyses](/training/boomTraining) using 
    researcher-provided data.
