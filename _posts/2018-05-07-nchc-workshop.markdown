## Background
For an overall understanding of geospatial data, read:
  * Types of spatial data are summarized in [spatial data](/researcher/spatialData)
  
## Species Distribution Modeling (SDM)
The potential distribution of individual species may be predicted using SDM tools:
  * Overview of [Species Distribution Modeling (SDM)](/researcher/sdm)
  * [Explore](/training/exploreData) SDM data from the LM Library
  * Request species [SDMs](/training/sdmTraining) through the website

## Macro-ecological Modeling
Distributions of many species may be combined to look at biodiversity at 
landscape levels: 
  * Overview of [Macro-ecological Modeling](/researcher/rad)
  * Request [Macro-ecological Modeling](/training/boomTraining) using 
    researcher-provided data.
  * Data for multi-species exercises is available on the USB stick or from
    [here](http://client.lifemapper.org/dl/taiwan_boom_data.tar.gz).

## Metacommunity Phylogenetic Analyses (MCPA)
Additional phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses can be performed with 
a phylogenetic (evolutionary) tree containing the same species and 
biogeographic maps of regions for which to compare species communities:
  * Overview of [MCPA](/researcher/mcpa)
  * [Visualize and Explore](/training/mcpaVizTraining) Metacommunity 
    Phylogenetic Analyses.  
  * [Subset](/training/subsetTraining) SDM for species
  * Two subsets are available from the USB drive or for download:
  
    * [Rubiaceae](http://client.lifemapper.org/dl/Rubiaceae.zip) 
    * [Geometridae](http://client.lifemapper.org/dl/Geometridae.zip)
