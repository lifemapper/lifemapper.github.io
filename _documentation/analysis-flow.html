<h2>Single-species Analysis</h2>

<p>
A typical Lifemapper workflow to analyze data for single species consists of 
computing a Species Distribution Model (SDM), and producing maps of potential
habitat from these models.  Inputs include:
<ul>
   <li> <a href="/documentation/occurrences.html">Occurrence Data</a>
        for a single species or taxa.  Species data may be from the Lifemapper
        data library (usually a data aggregator, such as the Global Biodiversity
        Information Facility (GBIF, <a href="www.gbif.org/>) </li>
   <li> A 
        <a href="/documentation/scenario.html">Scenario</a>
        (set) of 
        <a href="/documentation/layers.html">Environmental Layers</a> 
        corresponding to the approximate time period of the species data 
        (distant past, or current day). Lifemapper makes available Global Climate 
        data for past, current, and future time periods from Worldclim
        (<a href="http://worldclim.org>) </li>
   <li> An 
        <a href="/documentation/algorithm.html">Algorithm</a> 
        for computing the relationship between species occurrences
        and environmental values.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Each individual Environmental Layer must have a 
<a href="/documentation/typecodes.html">
Type Code</a>
which allows the software to identify the type of layer when <i>projecting</i> 
the model back onto the same or matching scenario. Scenarios <i>match</i> if 
they contain layers with the same type codes. Layers sharing type codes must 
represent the same type of environmental data, with the same units of 
measurement.
<p>

<p>
To request an SDM computation, a user will choose or upload an Occurrence 
dataset, a modeling Scenario, and
one or more projection Scenarios, choose an algorithm, and optionally modify 
the default algorithm parameters.

Currently these uploads and the SDM request happen in multiple steps, but 
the next version of the API will allow all inputs and parameters to be 
defined and uploaded at the same time.
<p>

<h2>Multi-species Analyses</h2>
<p>
A typical Lifemapper workflow to analyze multi-species data is more
complex and flexible. Some or all analysis steps can be executed,   
In Lifemapper, multi-species analysis inputs may start with:
<ul>
   <li>Species layers.  These layers can be raster or vector format, and can 
       be predicted (i.e. SDM output projections) or other types of distribution 
       maps.  </li>
   <li>A grid definition. This defines the geographic bounding box, geographic 
       projection, and grid cell size and shape</li>
   <li>A phylogenetic tree. This contains a tree in NEXUS format with leaves
       corresponding to each species layer in the analysis.</li>
   <li>Environmental layers.  These layers can be raster or vector format.</li>
</ul>
