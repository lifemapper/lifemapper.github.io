Studying biodiversity patterns includes describing, visualizing and analyzing 
different aspects of the numbers and abundances of taxa in both time and space. 
This can be done at multiple scales, looking at different resolutions of time, 
space, and even different levels of organism classification, like phylogenetic 
or taxonomic attributes.  Biodiversity patterns can be explained by species 
distributions and abundance.  These patterns are critical information for 
conservation and land management decisions.


There are major challenges related to study biodiversity patterns at large 
extents, high resolutions, and with thousands of species.  Lifemapper addresses 
these challenges by providing web services for assembling and analyzing many 
species distribution layers at multiple resolutions over arbitrary geographical 
extents.   These web services can be accessed programmatically and through the 
Lifemapper web app in the future.

Lifemapper is supported by US NSF grants EF-0851290, DRL-0918590, EPS-0919443, OCI-1135510, DEB-1208472, DB
