## Subsetting a populated, computed Lifemapper installation

Lifemapper installations may be populated with species and environmental data
of interest to a single researcher or institution.  These installations may
contain public species and environmental data available for a particular 
country, taxomomic group, or 
other focus.  

In these cases, SDMs for all species in the installation may be 
computed and intersected with a grid of choice for users to subset on one 
or more dimensions and request biogeographic analyses of the subset.  If 
phylogenetic data is available and joined to the species in the installation,
phylogenetic diversity and Meta-Community Phylogentic Analyses (MCPA) may be
performed on the subset.  Additionally, users may upload biogeographic 
hypotheses (vector datasets spatially delineating a possible influence on 
biodiversity) to answer questions about species, community, or 
phylogenetic distributions.
