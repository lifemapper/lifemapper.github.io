## Querying the contents of a Lifemapper installation

Aggregate queries will give you a sense of the size, depth and breadth of a
Lifemapper public archive.

To query input and output SDM data by time and status, use the the Python Client
Library 
[SDM Query functions](/docs/clientLibrary/classLmClient_1_1sdm_1_1SDMClient.html)
to get counts of objects filtered by time-date and status.  Digging into the 
parameter documentation will lead to the constants that define status and the 
input format required for date filters.
