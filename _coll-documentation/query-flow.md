## Querying the contents of a Lifemapper installation</h2>

Aggregate queries will give you a sense of the size, depth and breadth of a
Lifemapper public archive.

To query input and output objects by time and status, use the following Get 
operations to count or list objects that meet the filter criteria:


[Get OccurrenceSets](/documentation/api.html#!/Occurrence_Sets/get_sdm_occurrences_format)
[Get Projections](http://lifemapper.github.io/documentation/api.html#!/Projections/get_sdm_projections_format)
