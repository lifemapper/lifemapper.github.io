## Exploring Site statistics

1. Open the index.html file from one of the output packages included 
   on the USB drive.

1. Click the “Site Statistic Maps” link, the middle link under the 
   package contents.

1. On the left side, there is a select box that allows you to choose 
   which map statistic you would like to view.  Under the select box 
   you will find a brief description of the statistic.

1. On the right side, there is a map.  The values displayed are a 
   “heat map” showing the relative values for each cell.  The cells are 
   stylized such that more transparent values indicate lower relative 
   values and less transparent cells indicate higher relative values.

## Exploring statistic scatterplots

1. Open the index.html file from one of the output packages included on 
   the USB drive.

1. Click the “Scatterplots” link, the right-most link under the package 
   contents.

1. You will see two panels.  The panel on the left has a scatterplot and 
   the panel on the right is a map.

1. Use the select boxes under the scatter plot to plot the relationships 
   between the statistics.  The value on the left will be the y-axis and 
   the value on the right will be the x-axis.

1. Click and drag to create a selection around points in the scatter plot.  
   The corresponding cells will be highlighted in the map showing where 
   those values occur.

1. Alternatively, you can create a spatial selection on the map to see 
   where the values fall within the scatter plot by using the box or 
   polygon spatial select tools on the map.
