## Steps

1. Navigate to http://notyeti-191.lifemapper.org/biotaphy/ and select “Subset the 
   Global PAM” from the left-hand pane.  Alternatively, go directly to 
   http://client.lifemapper.org/biotaphy/subsetpam.html

1. This interface can take a few seconds to load given the amount of data that 
   has to be processed.  When it loads, it will fill in the select boxes with 
   the available options.  
   
1. Use the select boxes to narrow down the results to what you are interested 
   in for your subset, for instance, you may be interested in a genus, like 
   Saxifraga.
   
1. After every selection, the matching species list is updated with the species 
   that match your criteria and the map on the right will be updated with a 
   heat map indicating the relative number of species present at each location 
   that match your criteria.
   
1. You can then select the species you want to use for your subset by performing 
   a multi-select (control or shift + click) on the items in the “Matching 
   species” box.  Alternatively, do not select any of them and all of the 
   matching species will be used.
   
1. Give your subset a name by filling in the “Archive name” text field and click 
   “Submit PAM” to create your new subset.
