Several pre-subsetted datasets are available for download, or from the provided 
USB drive, including the [Rubiaceae](http://yeti.lifemapper.org/dl/Rubiaceae.zip) 
family of flowering plants, and the 
[Geometridae](http://yeti.lifemapper.org/dl/Geometridae.zip) family of moths.  

## Steps

1. Open the Lifemapper web client, by opening the 
   Rubiaceae/output/gridset-10-package/index.html file.  This will allow you to 
   browse the inputs and explore the outputs of multi-species, and phylogentic 
   analyses on this subset of the Taiwan data library.
