Biotaphy and additional terminology is at [Terminology](/terms.html)
    
## Steps

1. Open the Biotaphy web client, by navigating to 
   http://notyeti-191.lifemapper.org/boom.  This will allow you first explore and 
   then subset the global PAM for this Biotaphy instance.
   
1. This interface allows you to subset on a variety of variables.  Start by 
   selecting a taxonomic group that you are interested in.  Start by selecting
   a kingdom.
   
1. After selecting a kingdom, the select boxes will fill in with available
   options.  You can continue to select different taxonomic classifications as
   well as selecting algorithm, model and projection scenarios.

1. After each selection you make, the matching species list will be updated in the
   bottom left pane.  The map pane on the right will be updated as well with a 
   "heat map" indicating the relative number of species present in each cell.  The 
   transparency of the cells is determined by the proportion of the matching 
   species that are present in each cell.

1. When you are happy with your selections, enter an archive name in the text box
   at the bottom of the screen and press the "Subset PAM" button.  A request will
   be sent to the server to create a subset of the PAM and run the macro-ecological
   and MCPA computations on the resulting data.  This process can take a 
   considerable amount of time so we will show already completed results rather 
   than waiting for these to return.
