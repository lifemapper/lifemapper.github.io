Lifemapper and additional terminology is at [Terminology](/terms.html)

## Steps

1. Go to the Lifemapper web client
    * Go to http://svc.lifemapper.org/browse
      
1. IF you wish to browse your own data as well as public data, sign in to 
   or sign up for a Lifemapper account.  In the left pane of the webpage:
   
    * If you do not have a user account, create one by clicking the **sign up** 
      link below the Login button.
    * Once you have a user account, sign in with your username and password.
      
1. To query input and computed data in an Lifemapper installation by species,
   go to the right pane of the webpage, titled "Lifemapper Data".  
    
    * To explore some of the contents of this instance of Lifemapper, type 
      in the box, to get a list of species that start with the letters you typed.  
    * When you find a species, double click it to get the point layer, and a 
      list of projections available for that species.  
    * Double click a point layer, or projection layer to add it to the canvas on 
      the right.  
    * You may add as many layers as you like, but more layers will slow map
      performance.  Only one species is visible at a time, with one layer of
      points and one SDM projection layer.  Switch the visible species by 
      clicking the "eyeball" icon for the species you wish to view.
