## Steps

1. Navigate to http://notyeti-191.lifemapper.org/boom/

1. In the left-hand pane, under “Completed” select “Browse 
   Projections”.

1. In the right-hand pane, a text field will appear under 
   “Show SDM projections for:”, enter the first few letters of 
   the species you are interested in.

1. A list will appear under the text field of matching taxa, 
   continue typing into the text field until the species you are 
   interested in shows in the list.

1. Click the species name in the list.

1. A map will appear with the points and any projections associated 
   with the species you selected.  The name of the map will have 
   the code of the algorithm used, the model scenario code, and the 
   projection scenario code.

1. You can pan and zoom the map to explore the projection and point 
   data.  The orange dots represent occurrence points of the species 
   and the red grid cells represent areas where the species is 
   projected to have suitable habitat under the climate scenario.  
   Darker red indicates that the probability is lower and brighter 
   red indicates a higher probability of habitat suitability.
