## Multi-species analyses - Range and Diversity


1. Create a new experiment

    * Lifemapper (top menu) → LmRAD: Range and Diversity → New Experiment
    * Define Experiment Projection: use 4326, which is basic Geographic 
      Projection (also known as Latitude/Longitude) 
    * Define Input Grid:  the bounding box for the Southeast Asia data is 
      longitude 95 to 153 and latitude -11 to 21.  One degree (the map units) 
      is a good grid cell size.
    * Add LM species distribution models
    
        * Choose the Bioclim algorithm, then a scenario, either the current 
          (Worldclim 1.4) or a future.  
        * Search for species by typing in a few letters, then hitting search.  
        * Select a layer, then hit the **+** button to add it to the list
        
    * Fill in the parameters to determine presence or absence for a species in a 
      grid cell.  The Bioclim models in this archive are very simple and have 
      only values of 0, 50 and 100.  Choose 50 for the min and 100 for the max.
